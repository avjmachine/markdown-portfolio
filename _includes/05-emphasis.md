I am an **Engineer** from India, who **loves learning**. Most of my engineering knowledge is within the domain of **Mechanical**, **Computer Science** and **Electronics** engineering. I enjoy learning *math, science, technology, business, people skills, music, arts, languages* and a lot of other things. As you would have guessed, I am definiteley not a master in these fields, but this is what I love. Its just that I am addicted to learning due to curiosity. Regarding my expertise, I have worked for 6.5 years on computer simulations of **Crash Safety for Cars**, automated the evaluation processes primarily with **Python** and **AI algorithms**, spent a significant amount of time at home doing course projects in the field of AI and **self-driving cars**. I also have fun doing **DIY stuff** and have some exposure to **ROS, Arduino and Raspberry Pi**.
